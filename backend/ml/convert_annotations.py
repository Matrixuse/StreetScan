"""Annotation conversion helpers (template).

This file contains helper functions and instructions to convert common annotation
formats (LabelMe, COCO, PascalVOC) into YOLOv8-seg or COCO format for training.

This is a template — edit it according to the annotation tool you use. If you'd
like, I can add a converter for a specific tool (LabelMe, CVAT, Roboflow, etc.).
